# GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL-task-4
roject Overview

This project implements a generative text model using GPT or LSTM architecture to generate coherent paragraphs on specific topics. The model is trained on a dataset of text and can be used to generate text based on user prompts.

Installation Instructions

To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

- transformers for GPT-based models: pip install transformers
- tensorflow and keras for LSTM-based models: pip install tensorflow keras
- numpy and pandas for data manipulation: pip install numpy pandas
Usage

To use the model, simply run the Python script and provide a prompt. The model will generate text based on the prompt.

Model Architecture

The project supports two model architectures:

- GPT-based model: uses the transformers library to load a pre-trained GPT model.
- LSTM-based model: builds an LSTM model using keras and tensorflow.

Training

To train the model, you'll need to prepare a dataset of text and fine-tune the model on your dataset.
Requirements

- Python 3.x
- transformers library (for GPT-based models)
- tensorflow and keras libraries (for LSTM-based models)
- numpy and pandas libraries (for data manipulation)
